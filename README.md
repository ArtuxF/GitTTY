# GitTTY
GitTTY is a command-line tool designed to be your first line of defense when your desktop environment (like Hyprland) becomes corrupted or fails to start. It allows you to clone Git repositories directly from any TTY, making it easy to recover configurations, dotfiles, or emergency scripts to get your system back up and running.
